Over the last two decades, the use cases for virtualization have changed and evolved, but it’s still a key part of many workflows.

This sub-$1,000 machine offers reliable performance, phenomenal battery life, and a gorgeous display. You really can’t get much better than that. With an exceptional PCMark 10 score of 7,061, it toppled comparable machines like the Acer Swift Go 14 and the more expensive Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. This laptop also has a battery life of 17 hours on a single charge (a spectacular result!), so you don’t have trouble yourself with finding a wall outlet to juice up. Who should buy the Dell Inspiron Plus 14 Anyone looking for a laptop that checks off all the right boxes. Battery life and overall performance are outstanding, sure, but don’t forget about the gorgeous 14-inch 1400p display, which is “exceedingly well suited to office work and static imagery,” according to our review. It has a maximum brightness level of 418 nits and an anti-glare coating, so you can use this laptop in various lighting conditions. The design is far from sexy, but its hardware capabilities and amazing battery life make up for the uninspired aesthetics. Alternative option: If you’re willing to shell out the extra cash, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i ($1,699.99) is a more premium option. It’s loaded with a faster processor (Intel Core Ultra 9 185H), more RAM (32GB), and a higher resolution display (3200×2000). It also has a bigger screen that measures 16 inches and a killer keyboard. You can’t really go wrong here if you need high-end power for high-end engineering tasks.Read our full Dell Inspiron 14 Plus review Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 – Best battery lifeProsRemarkable battery lifeA great array of portsSturdy, lightweight designHigh-visibility displayConsVariable performance trails competitiorsA bit pricier than the competitionPrice When Reviewed:$1,754Best Prices Today: RetailerPriceLenovo$1279.85View Deal$1499.76View DealB&H$1699View DealPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwideProductPricePrice comparison from Backmarket$1279.85 at Lenovo$1499.76 at Amazon$1699 at B&HWhy we like the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 lasted a jaw-dropping 24 hours on a single charge. That’s a bonkers result, and I mean that in the best way possible. This is partly due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 processor, which is more power-efficient than Intel or AMD processors. The other factor is the lower-resolution 1920×1200 display. It doesn’t have a high refresh rate or a fancy OLED panel, so it doesn’t impact the battery much. In addition to the extraordinary battery life, it’s also lightweight at 2.66 pounds — it’s designed to be taken with you everywhere.Who should buy the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6Anyone with a jam-packed schedule. The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 is both long-lasting and portable, making it an ideal choice for a busy college student. That said, the keyboard is just okay and the display isn’t the sharpest we’ve ever seen, so you’ll need to keep those trade-offs in mind. If you’re not a big fan of the keyboard or display, you can always plug into external ones. This laptop has a decent port selection that includes a full-sized HDMI 2.1 port and a combination of Type-A and Type-C ports, so you shouldn’t have a problem hooking up to those peripherals.Alternative option: If you’re looking for a long-lasting 2-in-1, the Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro ($1,649) is a great choice. Not only did it last 23 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge, but it also features a gorgeous 2800×1800 AMOLED display.Read our full Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 review Acer Aspire Go 15 – Best budget optionProsAffordableDecent battery lifeGood display visibilityConsBig and bulkyCheap buildLimited performancePrice When Reviewed:$299Best Prices Today: RetailerPrice$269.99View Deal$299View DealPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwideProductPricePrice comparison from Backmarket$269.99 at Amazon$299 at AcerWhy we like the Acer Aspire Go 15The Acer Aspire Go 15 is a great laptop for day-to-day tasks like general web browsing, watching a streaming service, Microsoft Office, and so on. The Intel Core i3-N305 CPU won’t be able to handle more demanding applications, but that shouldn’t be a problem as long as your use is relatively light. The 53 watt-hour battery, however, lasted 12 hours on a single charge–a respectable result and definitely more than a full school day. Who should buy the Acer Aspire Go 15Anyone on a tight budget! It’s just $300 right now on Acer’s online store, a great value for a laptop with a 15.6-inch 1080p display. It isn’t stretched too thin for clarity and it even has decent contrast, which is hard to come by on a laptop priced this low. The port selection is pretty good, too. You’re getting USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, a Kensington lock slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a DC power adapter.

It has an AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, which is more than enough power to run games on the Medium or High graphics presets. The 1920×1200 IPS display is also big (16 inches!) and fast (165Hz), so it’s the perfect screen for those twitchy games in which every second matters. It’s a good value, but you’ll be tethered to an outlet, as the 56 watt-hour battery lasted about four hours on a single charge. That’s not a surprising result for a gaming laptop, especially one with a 16-inch screen.Who should buy the Acer Nitro V 16Anyone who needs a laptop that can handle schoolwork as well as gaming. The RTX 4060 graphics gives it the kick you’ll need for most modern games and the high refresh rate display will ensure that gameplay is nice and smooth. The keyboard isn’t the best and the whole thing is made of plastic, so it doesn’t have the most premium feel to it, but if you can overlook those nitpicks and strictly focus on the hardware inside, then you can’t get a better value than this.Read our full Acer Nitro V 16 review Asus Zenbook S 14 – Best ultraportable ProsTranscendent battery lifeA purposeful use of spaceLovely, surprisingly large OLED screenGreat audioConsKeyboard needs more key travelPerformance needs improvement, especially on batteryPrice When Reviewed:$1,499.99Best Prices Today: RetailerPriceAsus$1499.99View DealPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwideProductPricePrice comparison from Backmarket$1499.99 at AsusWhy we like the Asus Zenbook S 14The Asus Zenbook S 14 is featherlight at just 2.65 pounds, which is lighter than the comparable 13-inch MacBook Air (2.7 pounds). It’s also structurally sound, which is surprising given how light and thin this laptop is. According to our review, there’s a “minimal of flex when pressing hard upon the center of the keyboard and the display doesn’t demonstrate meaningful wobble.” The featherlight form factor is great, but the battery life is something else entirely. The Zenbook S 14 lasted a spectacular 21 hours on a single charge! Excuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor.Who should buy the Asus Zenbook S 14Anybody that’s looking for a compact productivity powerhouse. In addition to the lightweight form factor and fantastic battery life, the Zenbook S 14 also has a beautiful OLED touch display. The resolution is a sharp 2880×1800 and the refresh rate is a fast 120Hz. The fast refresh rate is ideal for smoother inking and mousing, and it makes it easier to look at the screen for longer periods of time. Finally, let’s end with the aesthetics. The silvery cracks on the lid resemble the silk of a spiderweb, which is unique and a real standout (in my opinion).

According to our review, “movies and games look realistic and vibrant” on the 14-inch 1980x1200p OLED touchscreen, although it can be difficult to view content in brighter environments because of the reflective surface. It also died at the 16 hour mark on a single charge, which is absolutely fantastic. That result outclasses comparable machines like the Lenovo Slim 7 14 Gen 9 and the HP Pavilion Plus Laptop 14. As for how it performs, you should have zero problems zipping through real-world tasks like web browsing, video conferencing, and so on. Who should buy the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Anyone that’s looking to pick up an affordable laptop with an OLED display. It’s so much more than that, though. The build quality is solid and day-to-day performance is both fast and responsive. Connectivity options are a bit limited, but that’s not unusual for a laptop in this price range. Overall, this is an exceptional budget laptop, as you can’t really beat the price to performance ratio.

If this is the case, the MSI Titan 18 HX is the nuclear option. It boasts a powerful Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 4TB of SSD storage, and 128GB of RAM. It’s an absolute beast of a machine and it will run anything you throw at it. That said, a laptop this powerful will drain the battery at a much faster rate. Also, it’s wildly expensive! Who should buy the MSI Titan 18 HXAnyone that needs intense computing power for video editing and 3D modeling. This laptop also has a 1080p webcam, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, and a massive 99.9 watt-hour battery. That said, it does weigh close to eight pounds and it costs $5,399.99. It’s not the most lightweight or budget-friendly laptop out there, but if it’s raw firepower you’re after, the MSI Titan 18 HX will certainly deliver on that front.Read our full MSI Titan 18 HX review Recent laptop reviewsSamsung Galaxy Book5 Pro: The Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro delivers incredible battery life, a beautiful display, and solid desktop performance. But for an extra $50, you could have this as a 2-in-1 machine with a bundled S Pen.Acer Swift 16 AI: The Acer Swift 16 AI is a capable machine with a big, beautiful screen, but its AI chops are still unproven.Lenovo Legion 5i: The Lenovo Legion 5i is a great value — a 16-inch gaming laptop with a screaming-fast CPU that also squeezes a surprising amount of performance from its GPU.Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition: The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition has elegance and feels great to use. But Lenovo should have stepped up its game, as the system lags behind in performance and battery next to a bunch of cheaper competitors, and Lenovo’s not the only brand making great-feeling systems.Lenovo LOQ 15: The Lenovo LOQ15 has better build quality than the average gaming laptop in this price range, but its performance is still on the low side.How we test engineering laptopsThe PCWorld team puts every Windows laptop through a series of intense benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we’ve tested. Below, you’ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them. For a much deeper look at our review methodology, check out how PCWorld tests laptops.Windows laptopsPCMark 10: The PCMark 10 benchmark is how we determine how well the laptop handles general use tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, streaming, and so on.HandBrake: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It measures how long a laptop’s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file.Cinebench: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It renders a 2D scene over a short period of time.3DMark: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. This is how we test a gaming laptop’s GPU.Video rundown test: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10’s Movies & TV app until the laptop dies. FAQ 1.How much processing power will I need in an engineering laptop?You’re going to need a good amount of processing power for engineering tasks, so we’d recommend an Intel Core i5 or higher. However, an Intel Core i7 is considered ideal. This type of processor is good for multitasking, gaming, and demanding workloads.2.Is RAM important to an engineering laptop?Absolutely! The amount of RAM directly impacts the speed of your programs. Engineering students will likely be living in programs like Java and Python, so making sure those programs run smoothly is absolutely vital. The bare minimum we’d recommend is 8GB, but 16GB is better.3.What about storage?You’re going to need quite a bit of space for a slew of engineering programs, so we’d recommend at least 512GB of SSD (solid state drive) storage.
